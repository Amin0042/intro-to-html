         <p>I am a first-year Graphic Design student at Algonquin College. I am passionate about creating artworks in any possible mediums especially Digital realm. I am originally from Iran. And I have grown up there. I have started my art journey by creating abstract doodling on paper and nowadays I am developing my ideas on the computer with the help of the knowledge, I have gained through all these years experiencing different mediums and styles. </p>
